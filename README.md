This repository contains a collection of practical exercises developed during the Machine Learning course at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV).
Each notebook explores a different algorithm or concept of supervised and unsupervised learning.

#	Topic	Description
2	Tokens	Preprocessing and tokenization of text data.
3	PCA (Principal Component Analysis)	Dimensionality reduction using eigenvalues and explained variance.
4	Gradient Descent	Implementation of gradient descent for optimization and cost minimization.
5	Naive Bayes	Probabilistic classification using Bayes’ theorem and feature independence.
6	Linear Regression	Predictive modeling and line fitting using least squares.
7	Decision Tree	Classification and regression using Gini impurity and information gain.
8	SVM (Support Vector Machine)	Separation of classes using hyperplanes and margin maximization.
